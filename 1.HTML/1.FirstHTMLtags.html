<!-- 
    The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is not case sensitive
    All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration
    The declaration is not an HTML tag, It is a "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.
    In HTML everything should be surrounded by tags!
    "p" is for paragraph and its element , others are tags.
    "b" is used for bold. but mostly not uses (strong is used instead now a days).
    "i" is for italian font. (em i used instead now a days).
