1) In react we always had to return single element as everything enclosed in 1 div , but that was creating
a problem.
2) so in recat 16.2 solution we got is enclose every component to be return in React.Fragment
        <!-- import React, {Fragment} from "react"; -->
        <!-- if we import fragment then no need to write React.Fragment , only fragment will work,
             only <> and </> also works same and no need to import also. -->
        function FAQ() {
            return (
                <!-- <React.Fragment> -->
                    <>
                    <p>Q. What is React?</p>
                    <p>A. A JavaScript library for building user interfaces</p>
                    <p>Q. How do I render sibling elements?</p>
                    <p>A. Use Fragments</p>
                    </>
                <!-- </React.Fragment> -->
            );
        }
